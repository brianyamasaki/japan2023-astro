# We caught the cherry tree blooms in Japan

We missed all the cherry tree blossoms in Tokyo by a couple weeks, but because Takayama is in the mountains, we were right on time to catch the blossoms.

Nancy poses in front of cherry trees growing on the banks of the river. The bridge we are standing on was a popular place for tourists to take pictures, as it's beautifully painted in a classic Japanese style.
