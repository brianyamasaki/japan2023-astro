# Just Wandering Around Takayama

These are just some pictures we took wandering around the city.

There are these Shinto gates all over Japan, and this is just another one of them, but I liked how you could see down the road to see the next gate. Nancy was tired of walking around by the time we took this picture.

It's not really Girls' Day today, but we found this display for [Hinamatsuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinamatsuri) in a local shop window. These are miniatures, not full sized dolls. Of course, it was all for sale.

## Nancy Makes a Point
We saw this sculpture in the middle of the bridge and Nancy had this reaction.
