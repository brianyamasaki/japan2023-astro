# The Fire Station

This is a big fire station, comparatively. There aren't a whole lot of fire stations in Takayama, that we could tell, anyway. So maybe they have fewer, but bigger fire stations?

A really old fire truck was on display inside the fire station.

This display was also inside the fire station. Apparently they expect tourists to be visiting the fire station?

The local town logo tells you all you need to know, that Takayama is in the mountains.

This friendly firefighter talked to us in our terribly broken Japanese and showed us around the station.
