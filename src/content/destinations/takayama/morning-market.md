# Takayama's morning market

Every morning, Takayama has a farmer's market. We went to see what's there. At this point, it's a well known tourist attraction.

Strawberry Daifuku is a very popular dessert in Japan. It's mochi on the outside with sweet bean filling with a whole strawberry inside.

We passed by a wood carver's shop and saw this in the window. It's Nancy's family crest, lovingly carved out of wood. We were really tempted to buy this, but it's big enough to not fit into our luggage.

We bought dango, which is small skewered mochi that is charcoal grilled, then covered with a sweetened soy sauce coating.
