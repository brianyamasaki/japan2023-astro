# Takayama's Festival Float Museum

Actually called the "Takayama Matsuri Yatai Kaikan," This is a museum that shows various floats that are used during a twice annual festival in Takayama, where these 2 ton (!) floats get wheeled through town.

We're taking a selfie inside the museum. 
The float in this picture has no wheels and must be carried on the shoulders of willing volunteers. The volunteers must all be the same height to carry it on their shoulders to carry the float through the street. They have multiple teams of volunteers because they can only carry the float for 15 minutes or so.

Some of these are around 30 feet tall and really heavy, some up to 2 tons. Those mannequins are life-sized, maybe 5 and a half feet tall.

The roof from one of the floats. It's incredibly detailed and covered in gold leaf. These floats are sometimes over 100 years ago. They've been lovingly maintained and upgraded through the decades. 
If it rains on the day of the festival, the floats are kept in storage to preserve them.
