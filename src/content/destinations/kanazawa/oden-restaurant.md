# Kuroyuri - A Famous Oden Restaurant

Selfie outside the Oden restaurant recommended by [Just One Cookbook](https://www.justonecookbook.com/historic-kanazawa-japan/). This restaurant is deep in the heart of the train station, near the high class gift shops of the station.

Her description of the restaurant is as follows: 

> This Oden shop has been around for more than 60 years and currently run by the 3rd generation of the family. The food was amazingly good, but they only allow you 90 minutes to eat since thereâ€™s a line of people waiting.

We had to order ala-carte, which is kind of difficult when you don't know the names of all your favorites. We did OK.

Croquettes are easy to remember since they are some of my childhood favorites. In the background is the tablets that helped us order, and luckily the tablet switches to English language.
