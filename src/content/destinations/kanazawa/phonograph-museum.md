# The Kanazawa Phonograph Museum

Brian was so excited to see this museum because he thought there would be all sorts of record players from the 20s all the way through to the 90s covering inexpensive consoles to high fidelity turntables. Didn't work out that way, though.

The museum was started by a collector who kept buying antique record players from around the world. A world who had moved on from wax cylinder recording to antique formats, lacquers and 78s and finally LPs and singles. The world was moving on to digital music and high fidelity and this collector wanted to remember the beautiful wood cabinets and brass cones.

That's an inexpensive ticket to see a museum.

This is close to the kind of turntable Brian had in college. And there's a huge selection of vinyl record to play on it. This is looking good.

That's a big, brass horn. Amplification in the old days was all about big horns, not electricity. In fact, most of these classic record players were hand cranked, not electric.

To prove the point of amplification with cones, this is a record player that uses a paper cup on the end of the record needle.

Beautiful rendition of an old time phonograph.

Because these record players were so large and took up an enormous amount of room in your living rooms, great care was taken to make them look bveautiful. The style and wood work was exceptional.

A docent was kind enough to take our picture. The cabinet of this phonograph is really beautiful, with hand carved accents and details.
