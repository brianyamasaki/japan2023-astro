# Our First Time in Kanazawa

![Selfie](/assets/kanazawa/PXL_20230411_043245440.jpg)

We took this selfie at a restaurant in the Kanazawa train station. Just a random restaurant, but we were pretty hungry after taking multiple trains from Takayama, through Toyama and finally to Kanazawa.

This is a digital sign that uses little water fountains as pixels. It alternately welcomed us and gave us the time.

We're taking a selfie in front of the famous Takayama wooden gate at the train station.
