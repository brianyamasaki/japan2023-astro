# Our Personal Guide to Kanazawa

We found a local who showed us around Kanazawa named Chikako Omote through the [Japanese Tourism Website](https://www.japan.travel/en/plan/list-of-volunteer-guides/). She made our visit to 
Kanazawa much more interesting and fun. 

Chikako guided us to the Silk Painting Experience and spent the rest of the day with us. 
She turned out to have lived in the Seattle area so we had a lot to share with her.

Kanazawa has many historical quarters, just like Takayama. Chikako is helping us visit the Samurai District.

Here's the two of us in the samurai district. It's fun to learn about how the big estates belong to the top level samurai, the middle level samurai had modest houses and low level samurais usually just shared a dump house.

This is an entrance to an upper level samurai's estate. It's fun to learn about how the big estates belong to the top level samurai, the middle level samurai had modest houses and low level samurais usually just shared a dump house.

Same garden, even better view.

The pond has pretty orange koi in it.

![roofs and gutters](/assets/kanazawa/PXL_20230414_051412856.jpg)

Even the roofs and gutters have artistic elements. Note that the "downspouts" are little cups hanging from the roof.

Nancy and Brian take a break in the study overlooking the magnificent garden.

![traditional architecture](/assets/kanazawa/PXL_20230414_065901752.jpg)

Traditional architecture and unpainted wood abound in samurai town and the geisha district, which wasn't far apart, for obvious reasons.

![narrow alleys](/assets/kanazawa/PXL_20230414_065915722.jpg)

These narrow alleys are so indicative of very old Japan.

We love these historical districts - something you don't see in the US.

![Another Shinto shrine](/assets/kanazawa/PXL_20230414_073014068.PORTRAIT.ORIGINAL.jpg)

It wouldn't be Japan without running into another Shinto shrine.
