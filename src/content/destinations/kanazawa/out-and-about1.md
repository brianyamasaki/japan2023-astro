# Out and About in Kanazawa

Our hotel is on the North side of the station, but most of the attractions are on the South side of the station, so we end up walking through the station every single day to get where we want to go. 

As typical in Japan, major train stations are the economic and commuting heart of any city.

While Taiyaki is classically just filled with Sweet Red Bean filling (anko), this deluxe model has anko, sweetened green tea filling and mochi. Fancy.

It's hard to avoid going into a Mister Donut when you find one.

We ate dinner at a Tonkatsu restaurant, right next to the Oden restaurant inside the Kanazawa Train station. Based on the chairs for the customers waiting in line outside the restaurant, this is a very popular restaurant.
