# We eat at an Izakaya

This was a tough decision for me since I figured this place wasn't for tourists (the name of the bar was in kanji only and they only had Japanese language menus). This izakaya was for locals. 

Neither of us can read a Japanese menu so we had to guess what might be on the menu and ask if they had it. The food was fantastic and the service was kind and good.
