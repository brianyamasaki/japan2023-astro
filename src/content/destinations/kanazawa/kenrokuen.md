# A Day in Kenrokuen Park

Kenrokuen park is reputed to be one of the three most beautiful parks in Japan. We wanted to spend time to see the beauty of this national treasure.

Across the road from the park is Kanazawa Castle. The park and castle are on hills while the road is in the valley in between. Makes for some pretty nice scenery.

There's the castle on the other side of the road.

Nancy stands in front of one of the many water features. The trees have branches that are spreading widely, so each branch is supported by wooden poles. It snows very heavily here and branches are often supported by ropes to keep the branches from breaking due to the weight of the snow.

A nice view of a waterfall as well as the tea house.

A selfie of us under cover, since the sun made for some harsh shadows.

The moss is beautiful here.

Clearly they wanted us to see this statue. I did not bother to figure out who it was.

This is one tree, spreading out very wide. When covered with snow, these wooden poles will help support the branches.

Of course they have large koi in the ponds.
