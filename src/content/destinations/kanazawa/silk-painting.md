# The Silk Painting Experience

This is a photo of [the silk studio](https://yuzen-youmei.com/) where we got our silk painting experience. Normally this studio would create custom hand painted fabrics for kimonos, art works and fabrics for any part of Japanese life. 

The proprietor told us that each kimono uses 12 meters (36.5 feet) of fabric. Hand painting all of that silk takes a lot of time, thus making custom silk kimonos incredibly expensive. Modern Japanese simply can't afford these extravagances.

There were so many parts of silk painting process that we can't remember all of them. 

Nancy and I had written our names onto the silk, then traced the lines with a natural gel. The proprietor heated up the silk pieces, then would wipe the resulting work with a wet brush. The natural gel would make it so the paint wouldn't color the silk at that point. At the end of the painting, the gel would get removed and natural wilk color would show through between colored areas.

Nancy chose to use her family crest as the painting subject. Brian chose to use a design of a flounder, something his mother really appreciated.

The proprietor's wife was a very patient and kind teacher. Brian is left and far right is Chikako, our Kanazawa guide.

The proprietor shows technique and does a quick touch up.

Brian is getting into the flounder, big time.

Nancy is making great progress. She holds the brush in a very Japanese Calligraphy style.

Brian and Nancy have finished their silk painting, with plenty of color washes and solid colors.

Notice how the black lines that separated our colors have washed away and leave the color of the natural silk.
