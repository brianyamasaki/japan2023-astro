# Arriving in Miyajima

![first view of the torii gate](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_011735249.MP.jpg)

Views of the famous torii gate, seemingly floating on the water.

![This island is mountainous](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_011809233.MP.jpg)

Take a look how mountainous this island is.

![Arrival at the ferry dock](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_012656724.MP.jpg)

We've arrived on Miyajima after crossing on the ferry.

![that's the ferry](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_012806610.jpg)

A view back toward the main island.

![View through a rock](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_012921297.jpg)

A single standing stone column had a polished hole through it, and it frames a beautiful picture of the torii.

![The walkway to town](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_013431709.MP.jpg)

The ferry isn't in town, so you have to walk along the path next to the beach to get to the main town. It's a long way to tow your luggage, so try not to bring much.

![A view back to the ferry](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_013738823.jpg)

Just a view back toward the ferries. There are two ferries that go to and from the main island to Miyajima. Two competing companies basically using the same dock. How civilized.

![The Pagoda](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_014227322.jpg)

There's a pagoda that you pass on the way to downtown.

![The Ryokan](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_015749129.jpg)

This is our first view of our Ryokan. Note that this is an entry level Ryokan and they expect non-Japanese speaking tourists. Most high end ryokan requires Japanese language skills to get a reservation.

![Just the view](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_021326983.PORTRAIT.ORIGINAL.jpg)

The park next to the Ryokan has a great view. That's *probably* Hatsukaichi, a neighboring town of Hiroshima.

![Selfie with a view](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_021308102.jpg)

A double selfie

![Single Selfie](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_021338507.jpg)

Yup, we take a lot of pictures.

![A stairway](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_022807704.jpg)

There are a few paths and roads on this very hilly island. So here's a stairway.

![Looking over the temple](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_022855314.jpg)

Another view of the pagoda and the temple in front of the big, red torii.

![Not Real Deer](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_023326078.jpg)

The island has thousands of feral deer. These are much tamer and cleaner.

![Sitting at last](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_024745065.jpg)

After a morning of being a tourist, we get to sit down.

![Kara age chicken](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_025457336.jpg)

We found a restaurant blocks away from the downtown tourist traps and the food was very good and the prices were reasonable. This is the kara age fried chicken meal.

![Katsu domburi](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_025606185.jpg)

This is the Katsu Domburi meal.

![Momiji Manju](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_031047931.PORTRAIT.jpg)

Everywhere you go in Japan, the community boasts about their local specialty food. In Miyajima, their sweets are fashioned to look like maple leafs and called Momiji Manju.

![A look inside](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_031104827.PORTRAIT.jpg)

Here's a look inside a Momiji Manju.

![Itsukushima Shrine](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033153142.jpg)

While I've been calling it Miyajima, the island is officially called Itsukushima and the giant red torii gate in the water is actually part of the Shinto shrine named Itsukushima Jinja (shrine). We're walking through the shrine, which is built on top of pilings over the bay. You can see that the tide has ebbed away in this picture.

![Away from the crowds](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033310642.MP.jpg)

Nancy is posing in a temporarily empty hallway (soon to be filled by tourists). Beautiful paint job.

![Still empty](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033317833.jpg)

A slightly different view.

![dual selfie](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033421182.jpg)

In this selfie, you can see the tide has ebbed so that it just leaves the ground under the temple almost dry.

![View out to the bay](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033510062.jpg)

Here's a different angle so you can see the torii gate, mostly on dry land.

![another selfie](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033536822.jpg)

Tourists were waiting in line to take pictures on the far right of the picture. Nancy chooses an equally beautiful, less crowded shot.

![Looks kind of Chinese in style](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033602858.jpg)

It's highly decorative. Brian can't say he likes it, though.

![Another view of the temple](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033608447.jpg)

Tide is totally out to see.

![The pagoda isn't far](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033617628.jpg)

A viewpoint that includes the pagoda on the North side of the temple.

![Framed Torii](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033630304.jpg)

Brian likes this framing of the torii.

![Temple exposed](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033723337.jpg)

The temple piers are totally exposed in this picture.

![A nice perspective](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033728985.jpg)


![That's a lot of sake](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033906481.jpg)

These elaborately decorated barrels are for sake. 

![A performance](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_033959266.jpg)

There was a play happening while we were touring the temple. We think it was a Noh play. Totally in Japanese.

![Traditional bridge](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_034037346.jpg)

Pretty bridge. Pretty unnecessarily arched bridge.

![Noh closeup](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_034052311.jpg)

A closeup of the actors in the play.

![On the beach](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_034917213.jpg)

After you leave the temple, you can walk out onto the beach and walk all the way out to the torii gate.

![closer](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_034947261.jpg)

![very close](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_035533407.jpg)

This gate is really large!
