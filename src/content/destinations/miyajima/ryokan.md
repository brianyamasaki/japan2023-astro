# Ryokan Juseiko

![Sign](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_015721400.jpg)

We saw this sign near the main road, prior to climbing the stairs to the Ryokan itself.

![Welcome](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230418_000627426.jpg)

Kind of fun to see a sign welcoming you to your lodgings. Perhaps not great for privacy reasons, though.

![our room](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_061416778.MP.jpg)

Brian relaxes on the chair in the room.

![Traditional Tatami Room](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_061609321.jpg)

Ryokan are generally classical Japanese rooms with tatmi mat floor and beautiful wood everywhere. We had a beautiful view (except for the building under repair in the middle)

![Include the table](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_070819850.jpg)

A wider view shows the table where the legless chairs with futons sits. At the far end of the room is a small alcove where we find a water boiler where we can make tea.

![A different angle](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_070839919.jpg)

In one side of the room, there are just sliding doors covering closets. Inside the closets are futons and blankets.

![fancy yukata](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_071802600.jpg)

Everywhere in Japan, hotels usually provide pajamas to sleep in. In Ryokans, they suggest you wear yukata while in the building. These are pretty spiffy.

![Private Bathing](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_080039944.jpg)

Onsen means a place where travelers can bathe in public hot tubs (often naturally heated). Normally you can't photograph public baths because it's really rude to customers. But this ryokan had private bathing that you could reserve for your room. In the foreground you can see the handheld showers to clean and rinse your body before you get into the very hot spa water.

![Private Bathing 2](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_081606096.jpg)

Those wooden slats are just slats, no windows holding the air in or out.

![beautiful vista](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_082539401.jpg)

It's very calming to sit at this table with a hot tea or cold drink and look over the island.

![Put on the vest](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_092316491.MP.jpg)

If you want a little more warmth, the vest supplied was stylish and warm.

![Dinner starts](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_092641520.jpg)

This ryokan required you to come to the restaurant for meals (more exclusive ryokans offer in room meal service). This is the place setting as we entered the restaurant and the view is outstanding. We had earlier chose a dinner start time, so they were expecting us to arrive.

Top down view.

![Full view out the window](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_092845329.jpg)

Great view of the town and the torii. The tide had come back in by dinner time.

![Dressed up for dinner](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_092905278.MP.jpg)

Brian looks dressed for dinner.

![Cheers](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_092926495.jpg)

Cheers

![sashimi starter](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_093207233.jpg)

This meal is many courses of small, traditional Japanese dishes. This is the sashimi starter.

![Just add red wine](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_093928104.jpg)

Instead of ordering sake, Brian ordered red wine.

![Nancy is happy](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_093940706.jpg)

Nancy is positively glowing.

![exquisite presentation](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_094005690.PORTRAIT.jpg)

Gorgeous. Eating with your eyes as much as eating for your mouth and tummy.

![Brian digs in](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_094019836.PORTRAIT.jpg)

Itadakimasu (let's eat)

![oysters](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_094517626.jpg)

Miyajima is famous for their oysters (we passed the floating oyster farms when we rode the ferry here). Since Nancy doesn't eat oysters, Brian gets two.

![Nancy's replacement](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_094521876.jpg)

This is what Nancy had in lieu of her oyster.

![Nice Oyster](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_094847831.MP.jpg)

Brian enjoys these oysters, much milder in flavor than ones in Washington.

![self timer shot](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_095629625.jpg)

Brian is never ready when the self timer photo takes the shot.

![hot pot](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_095916319.PORTRAIT.jpg)

Cook your own hot pot

![mmm](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_095941953.PORTRAIT.ORIGINAL.jpg)

![another course](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_100259707.PORTRAIT.ORIGINAL.jpg)

Beautiful presentation of sashimi with attendant herbs.

![Nancy came hungry](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_100855532.jpg)

Nancy is still eating. There is a LOT of food for dinner.

![Starting hot pot](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_100907533.jpg)

Start with the mushrooms and onions to flavor the broth.

![unagi domburi](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_102737337.jpg)

Unagi domburi and miso shiru. The servings are small, but keep coming.

![dessert](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_104629350.PORTRAIT.jpg)

A beautiful end to a wonderful meal.

![Beds are made](/assets/miyajima/PXL_20230417_110417720.jpg)

When you come back to your room, the hotel staff have put away the low table and chairs and made the futon beds.

We forgot to mention the simple flower arrangement in the room.
