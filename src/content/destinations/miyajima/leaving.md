# Leaving the Ryokan and Miyajima

After breakfast, we checked out of the Ryokan and headed into town, heading toward the ferry that would take us back to the main island.

Miyajima shops that are closed and streets that are deserted. The tourists haven't arrived yet.

Deer are everywhere on the island. Don't taunt them because some can get angry.

We stop by a shop that makes the Momiji confection, which is well known around Japan. 

We thought this would be one of the few places that manufacture the Momiji fresh. We were wrong. Many shops manufacture it using similar, if not identical machines.

### The Ferry Home

We're sad to leave Miyajima, but ready to get back on a train to our next Destination.
