# Train Station Lunch Boxes

When you can't read the language it's often just easier to show a picture of something that you want if you can't just pick it up by yourself (or if the sample is just plastic food for display only). 
We often take pictures of stuff, then ask the clerk for "this" and show them our cell phones. That's what happened here.

Brian thinks we bought these in Kanazawa so we could eat them on our multiple train rides to Hiroshima. On long train rides like on the Shinkansen, it's actually a good idea to bring food to eat on the train ride. On short rides like around town, it's not OK to eat food.
