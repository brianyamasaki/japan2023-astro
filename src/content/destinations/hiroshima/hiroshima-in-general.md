# In, Out and About

This is the breakfast spot in our Hiroshima hotel. It's a repurposed old factory (Brian's guess). It feels very 1950s or 1960s. The aged and weathered look has a cool vibe to it.
These windows give fantastic natural life during breakfast.

Brian is getting ready to eat his ham and cheese crepe, one of the morning breakfasts made by the staff.

Interestingly, this is one of the larger bathrooms we had in our stay in Business Hotels. The obligatory Toto bidet/toilet with heated seats are in a separate room from the shower/bath.

We collected an awful lot of gifts from friends and relatives and we bought gifts to bring to our families back in the US. We're going to have to ship these back to the airport for our trip home.

Brian packs the box to forward to Narita airport. This makes it much easier to travel to our next few destination, without carrying this extra box.

A sweet crepe instead of savory on our last day in the hotel.
