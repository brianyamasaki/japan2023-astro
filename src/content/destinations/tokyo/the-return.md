# Return to Tokyo

We had to go back to Tokyo because we're flying out of Narita airport, the same airport we arrived at.

Behind Nancy's shoulder is the Hachiko statue. There was a very long line of people who wanted to take a picture with the Hachiko statue - we just didn't have time to wait in the line.

We bought cream puffs at [Beard Papa's](https://www.beardpapas.com/) somewhere in Shibuya station.

This is a business that makes gourmet rice balls (onigiri). It's new to us.

Three gourmet onigiri.

We've got a repeat of a favorite on this trip. Dango with sweetened soy sauce glaze.

These tasty rices mixed with savory ingredients look amazing. Once again, we have to "guess" what's in them because we really can't read them.

The mixed rices are served in abura age - oil fried tofu, simmered in a sweet and savory sauce - making this an inari sushi with extra special rice.

Headed home on our Business Class seats. Vacation is nice, but it's always good to go home.
