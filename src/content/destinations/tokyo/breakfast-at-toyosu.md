# Breakfast at Toyosu Market

We made an early morning trip to have breakfast at the Toyosu market in Tokyo.

This is the sunrise we saw as we got on our first train of the morning.

Toyosu is the famous fish and produce market where Tokyo gets the freshest food in Japan. My cousin Natsuko and her daughter Satori have brought us here and are looking at the menu.
