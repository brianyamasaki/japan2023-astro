# An Authentic Japanese Yakitori Dive Bar

Nancy's friend Yuko lived in Seattle for many years before moving back to Tokyo. She took us to an authentic yakitori bar. 

**Interesting Business Model:** The drinks are free for the first two hours as long as you keep ordering food (beer and mixed drinks as well as soft drinks).
