Nancy and Brian arrive at teamLab Planets. They were sold out of tickets for most of the day in half hour increments.

Teamlab exhibits are often in water almost up to your knees, so they offer free shorts. And since they have mirrors on the floors and ceilings, there are modesty issues at play. Nancy is taking a picture straight down in one of their rooms.
