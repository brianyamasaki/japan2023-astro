# Near Okayama Station

We stayed in the JR Granvia Hotel in Okayama and it's right next door to the station (that's typical when you choose a JR Granvia in any city). Literally 100 meters walk to the station.

We can see people hailing taxis and getting on buses.

From our hotel room, we can see inside the station to see how busy the station is.

Being close to the station guarantees a lot of places to shop and eat near the station.

One evening the hotel had musicians playing in the lobby. Beautiful music and I loved their costumes. Who would think about combining a harp and extra large koto?
