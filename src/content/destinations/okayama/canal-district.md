# The Canal District

The Canal district near Okayama is actually called the [Kurashiki Historical District](https://goo.gl/maps/aDKh8R18EzdBKcb67). It's a quaint area and an interesting mix of European and Japanese architecture complete with a short canal, beautiful landscaping and crewed gondolas, a little reminiscent of Venice, Italy.

The Ohara Museum of Art is the rare private museum in Japan that owns authentic artworks from European masters Monet, Pisarro, Rodin and more.

The museum architecture is distinctly European. This building could be standing in Athens, Greece or Italy.

A sculpture by Rodin. One of the few things we could take pictures of.

The lunch menu. Brian may have taken this picture because he can't read the Japanese.

We both order the same.

The gondolas are ready and waiting for the tourists, who haven't really arrived yet.

The swan is beautiful to look at, but closer inspection reveals that the swan is actually kept captive here in the canal. There's a gate under the bridge ahead and there is a feeding station out of sight. Brian guesses the wings have been clipped as well. Sigh.

Check out these Covid Masks. They're made out of denim. There are plenty of blue jean and denim clothing shops nearby, just in case tourists can't make it to the Kojima Blue Jeans district.
