# Welcome to the Blue Jeans District

Back in the 1960s, [the area around the Kojima station](https://www.japan.travel/en/japan-magazine/exploring-jeans-street-in-kojima-city-dyed-in-indigo/) was known for manufacturing blue jeans, primarily exported to America. Levi Strauss actually contracted to [manufacture blue jeans here in Kojima](https://foundland.com/journal/kojima-japan-s-denim-capital/). Blue Jeans are [still manufactured and sold here](https://www.okayama-japan.jp/en/spot/906) and are now [super premium](https://www.vogue.com/article/best-japanese-denim-brands-selvedge-jeans) and totally customizable (and priced accordingly).

Every sign is cute.

The history of blue jeans being born during the gold rush is explained, I guess. It's in Japanese...

![Made in Japan?](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_052742495.jpg)

I don't think these were made in Japan in 1938, but that's what they are saying.

![Sanding Experience](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_054029682.jpg)

Sanding blue jeans? What are these for.

![leg wrinkles](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_054036893.jpg)

Does this look like something you might see on blue jeans?

![See the texture now?](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_054041282.jpg)

Guess what happens if you put the texture underneath the blue jeans and then use sandpaper on their surface?

![Cutting pattern](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_054620397.jpg)

These are the cutting patterns for one specific size of blue jeans. 

![too much sanding](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_054823279.jpg)

The sanding on these have gone a bit excessive. 

![denim suit](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_054855724.jpg)

Denim suit anybody?

Everything old is new again. Bell bottoms are Back.

Big John is a major brand in Japanese Blue jeans and their flagship store is everything denim. Including this couch.

![hanging jeans 3](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_070641674.jpg)

You see these blue jeans hanging in the middle of the roadway, right? Cotton denim blue jeans hanging out in the rain. Do you think they take them down after a couple months and sell them for more money because they've naturally aged?

![more hanging jeans](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_070841033.jpg)

Not to be outdone, the next block has more jeans hanging in the street.

![Branded bathrooms](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_070941730.jpg)

In a vacant lot, they've erected a public toilet and painted it into this homage to blue jeans. Fantastic and no graffiti.

![places to sit](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_070941852.jpg)

A covered place to sit in that same vacant lot.

![candle?](/assets/okayama/PXL_20230418_071349742.PORTRAIT.jpg)

These are traffic dividers that keep cars from driving into the public toilet lot. Somebody has decorated them with denim fabric and something on top that makes them look like decorative candles.
