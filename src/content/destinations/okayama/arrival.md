Nancy loves melon flavored anything, so we picked up a melon flavored cream filled pastry at a local shop and we're taking a bite in the Shinkansen.

One story in Japanese folklore is about [Momotaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momotar%C5%8D), or "peach boy" (he was found in a peach). Okayama Train station has a statue to honor the story.
